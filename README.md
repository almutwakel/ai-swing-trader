<h4> How does the algorithm work? </h4>

This algorithm uses Machine learning to predict the price change of any inputted stock on the NYSE on the next market close. One Neural Network algorithm and one Linear Regression algorithm is used in the software. Each algorithm states its expected change in price and its confidence percentage in its prediction. Both AI analyze patterns in the daily movement of the chosen stock over a certain time period, which is configurable.

<h4> For Use </h4>

Please use your own judgement while following the recommendations of this software. No prediction is guaranteed to be correct. Please be aware that the software does not analyze current events, so adjust accordingly.

The results of the linear regression algorithm are labeled under Linear Regression Bot and the results from the neural network algorithm are labeled under my name, Almutwakel Hassan. For best results please use both algorithms together.
